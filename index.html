        The majestic ambience and massive bar with a mother-of-pearl finish set
        Prequel apart from other resto-bars in the city. This vast
        industrial-chic space, under AA Hospitality, is adorned with tasteful
        paper lamps, rattan chairs and lots of leafy plants. The folks behind
        Brassa, Misu and Lucky Chan have put together an expansive menu of food
        and cocktails that offer a unique twist on familiar flavours. Think raw
        mango and peanut chicken tikka or poha crusted fish fingers. Look
        forward to a range of European, Middle-Eastern and pan-Asian cuisines,
        and sample Indian grills, sushi, dim sums, as well as their distinctive
        sundal hummus. Prequelâ€™s signature drinks pay homage to iconic films,
        such as The Godfather, Revenge of the Sith and Annabelle. Nestled in
        Hebbal, Prequel has created considerable buzz since its debut, and there
        are already plans to open more branches in the near future.
